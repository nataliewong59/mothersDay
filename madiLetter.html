            <p>To our dearest Mother Goose,</p>
            <p>Happy Mother's Day! I wish mui and I could be there with </p>
            <p>you to celebrate in person but I guess that means we'll </p>
            <p>have to party EVEN harder when we reunite in the summer :) </p>
            <p>Thank you for always being a strong, encouraging, and </p>
            <p>confident woman to look up to. I hope you know (and I’m not </p> 
            <p>just saying this to be a brown noser) that I have always </p>
            <p>considered the best compliment I can get to be when people </p>
            <p>say “you look just like your mom” or “you remind me so much </p>
            <p>of your mom!” All I want to be when I grow up is you!! I'll </p>
            <p>always be grateful for endless love you provide, the trust </p>
            <p>you put in me, and your support as I'm thrust into adulthood. </p>
            <p>I absolutely would not be given the chance to successfully </p>
            <p>make it in this big bad tough world as a young creative </p>
            <p>without you holding my hand through it. I can say that I'm </p>
            <p>full of big dreams and aspirations and goals because of you. </p>
            <p>I’d be a much more pessimistic sad uncultured girl without </p>
            <p>my momma. I hope you know that you’re literally the mom that </p>
            <p>everyone wishes they had. You are the mom people dream of in </p>
            <p>therapy lol#allthehatersarejealousofme #sorrynotsorry </p>
            <p>#mymomisbetterthenyourmomduh </p> 
            <p>Love, </p>
            <p>Your eldest! </p>
            <p>P.s. Hope you liked the flowers (hope they got to you…it’s </p>
            <p>my first time trying this) even though I know we will put a </p>
            <p>prettier one together after a trip to the flower market :-))</p>
