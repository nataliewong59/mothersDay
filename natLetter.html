            <p>Dear mother goose,</p>
            <p>Happy Mother's Day! Thank you for being the literal best </p>
            <p>momma in the world, I don't think I've met another momma </p>
            <p>as considerate, understanding, supportive, and talented </p>
            <p>as you are. Thank you for being there for me 24/7 whenever </p>
            <p>I'm feeling down, you somehow always manage to cheer me up </p> 
            <p>even if you are only with me virtually. Especially during </p>
            <p>these last few months where I've been stressed about </p>
            <p>transfers and homesick much more often, you never fail to </p>
            <p>be there when I need you and never complain about having to </p>
            <p>deal with my anxious spam texts. I don't know if it is </p>
            <p>because I'm maturing or because I am meeting more people who </p>
            <p>aren't as fortunate, but I've realized more and more how </p>
            <p>lucky I am to have loving parents who are so involved in my </p>
            <p>life: fully paying for my academics, being there for me when </p>
            <p>I'm lonely/bored, supporting my interests, and encoruaging </p>
            <p>me to do things that'll make me happy, are all things that I </p>
            <p>haven't shown enough appreciation for. After all, how many </p>
            <p>people can actually say that their mom is one of their best </p>
            <p>friends? Anyways, I wish I could give you a nicer physical </p>
            <p>gift, maybe bake you a yummy tart or somethings, but for now, </p> 
            <p>I hope you enjoy this card that proves you aren't wasting </p>
            <p>money on my computer science degree. Can't wait to be home!</p>
            <p>SO MUCH LOVE,
            <p>nat :3</p>
